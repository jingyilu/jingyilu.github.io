Hello, I’m Jing-Yi Lu, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and the Field Museum.

I study the interplay among pollinator interactions, geography, floral traits, and speciation in Southeast Asian sunbird-pollinated _Aeschynanthus_ (Gesneriaceae). Integrating comparative approaches with ecological experiments, I focused on divergence and pollinator shifts in the morphologically and geographically distinctive _A. acuminatus_ and its closest relatives.
