Hello, I’m Jing-Yi Lu, a botanist and evolutionary biologist. I am currently working with Dr. Rick Ree at the Field Museum, Chicago, IL, US.

Originally from Taiwan, I recently completed my PhD in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. Before moving to the United States for graduate study, I earned my bachelor's degree in Life Science from National Taiwan University.

My current research focuses on the interplay among pollinator interactions, geography, floral traits, and genetic divergence in the Southeast Asian sunbird-pollinated genus _Aeschynanthus_ (Gesneriaceae).
