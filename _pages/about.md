Hello, I’m Jing-Yi Lu, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum, Chicago, IL, US. I am currently working with Dr. Rick Ree on plant evolution.

Originally from Taiwan, I recently completed my PhD in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. Before moving to the United States for graduate study, I earned a BS in Life Science from National Taiwan University.

I study the interplay among pollinator interactions, geography, floral traits, and speciation in the Southeast Asian sunbird-pollinated genus _Aeschynanthus_ (Gesneriaceae). Integrating comparative approaches with ecological experiments, I focused on divergence and pollinator shifts in the morphologically and geographically distinctive _A. acuminatus_ and its closest relatives.
