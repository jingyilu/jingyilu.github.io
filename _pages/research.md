    <h3>How do plants evolve under a geographic mosaic of pollinators at the macroevolutionary scale?</h3>
    	Plant-pollinator interactions are a compelling subject for investigating the links between microevolution and macroevolution across the temporal scale. Meanwhile, uneven distribution of animal pollinators forms geographic mosaics at the landscape level. How do plants respond and evolve to a geographic mosaic in pollinator availability? The SE Asian genus *Aeschynanthus* (Gesneriaceae) is an ideal system to study how plants with specialized pollination systems evolve under a geographic mosaic of pollinators. I have been investigated the key questions of pollinator-driven speciation in the divergence of *A. acuminatus* from its closest relatives, focusing on pollinator shifts and potential historical geographic changes.
