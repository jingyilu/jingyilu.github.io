I am generally interested in plant evolution through space and time. Plant-pollinator interactions are a compelling subject for investigating the links between microevolution and macroevolution across the temporal scale. Uneven distribution of animal pollinators forms geographic mosaics at the landscape level. How do plants respond and evolve to a geographic mosaic in pollinator availability? I investigated key questions of pollinator-driven speciation in the SE Asian genus <em>Aeschynanthus</em> (Gesneriaceae).

    <h3>Can the classic pollinator-driven speciation model explain species origin?</h3>

    <p>
    The classic Grant-Stebbins model of pollinator-driven speciation predicts that a plant species encountering different pollinators across its range may undergo local adaptation and, subsequently, ecological speciation. The pollinator shift to generalist bird, derived from sunbird specialist ancestors, in the East Asian <em>Aeschynanthus acuminatus</em> (Gesneriaceae) provides an unique opportunity to ask if the classic model can explain its origin. I tested among evolutionary scenarios by integrating studies of phylogeography, pollination, and floral morphology.
